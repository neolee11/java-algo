/**
 Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

 According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

 Example:

 Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
 Output: 3
 Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
 received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 Note:

 If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

 Follow up:

 This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
 Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
